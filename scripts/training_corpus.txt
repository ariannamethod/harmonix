what is resonance
what is not
what subtle resonance
what is arrange
rather is resonance
what is mild
what is smooth
what is process
what barely resonance
what is diffuse
tell me about
me about clouds
words dance in the cloud
resonance finds its own path
constraint births form
silence holds meaning
patterns emerge from chaos
the field morphs with use
dissonance creates tension
harmony resolves discord
waves meet in space
