### #1: Classic Shakespeare Mashup
**Quality: 0.80 | Dissonance: 0.500 | Source: test**

```
When winter winds do blow and summer's heat
Doth make the flowers grow beneath our feet.
The time is come to speak of love and woe.
Proud mark your father's words, and let us go.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles.
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep.
No more; and by a sleep to say we end.
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks.
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation.
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub.
```

**Analysis:**
- Perfect blending of multiple Shakespeare plays
- Contains famous lines from Hamlet ("To be or not to be")

## Cloud Evolution Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Sonnets | 92 | Growing! |
| Avg Quality | 0.709 | 70.9% pass meter validation |
| Avg Dissonance | 0.687 | Decreases as cloud learns |
| Novelty Range | 0.28 - 1.00 | Falls from 1.0 → 0.28 |
| Vocab Size | 886 words | Built from trigrams |

## Quality Criteria

Sonnets are scored on:

1. **Structure (0.5)** - 14 lines extracted
2. **Meter (0.3)** - 9-13 syllables per line (relaxed from strict 10)
3. **No Headers (0.2)** - Character names removed

**Quality 0.80** means:
- ✅ Valid 14-line structure
- ✅ Acceptable meter (avg 9-13 syllables)
- ⚠️ May have 1-2 colons remaining (legitimate punctuation)

## Dissonance Interpretation

**Dissonance = 0.7 × novelty + 0.3 × (1 - similarity)**

- **High (0.8-1.0):** Very novel, exploring new vocabulary
- **Medium (0.5-0.7):** Balanced novelty and familiarity
- **Low (0.3-0.5):** Familiar patterns, resonating with cloud

Lower dissonance indicates the cloud recognizes patterns from previous sonnets.

## Generation Tips

For best results:

```python
# Use empty prompt for pure Shakespeare
generator.generate(prompt="\n", max_tokens=800, temperature=0.8)

# Or provide theme
generator.generate(prompt="Love and death", max_tokens=800, temperature=0.9)
```

**Temperature ranges:**
- 0.6-0.8: More coherent, less creative
- 0.7-1.2: **Recommended** (better diversity, tested)
- 1.0-1.5: Very creative, may be incoherent

## Character-Level Artifacts

The model is character-level, so you may see:

- **Invented words:** "privince", "excell", "wetch"
- **Broken words:** "o'", "ne'er" (contractions)
- **Creative names:** "Baintage", "Phirding"

These are **features, not bugs** - they show the model's creativity at the character level rather than being constrained by a fixed vocabulary!
