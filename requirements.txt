# Harmonix Ecosystem - Global Dependencies
# Each ипостась has its own requirements.txt in its directory

# For development/testing of the entire ecosystem
# Individual ипостасей can be installed separately

# HAiKU dependencies (see haiku/requirements.txt)
# Sonnet dependencies (see sonnet/requirements.txt - coming soon)
# Prose dependencies (see prose/requirements.txt - coming soon)

# To install all:
# pip install -r haiku/requirements.txt
# pip install -r sonnet/requirements.txt  # when available
# etc.

# Or install everything at once (when all ипостасей are ready):
# find . -name requirements.txt -exec pip install -r {} \;
